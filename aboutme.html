      Hi, my name is Allison. I am 13 years young, as my birthday is on November 12, 2003.
      I am a triplet, and I live with my sisters, Anneliese and Elizabeth, and my parents.
      I like to read, and my favorite books are Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, The Hunger
      Games, Divergent, Maze Runner, and Shadowhunters. I know, I have a lot of favorites.
      Some fun fact about me are that I could do the Rubiks Cube in 2 minutes when I was 7 years
      old, and I live in a house with a theater, arcade and water slide! I hope you enjoyed
      reading this, and learned something about me.
